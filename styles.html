    <h1>Adding Styles in HTML</h1>
    <h2>Example 1: (Best Practice)</h2>
    <p>
      The styles for this image are kept in a separate file, known as a
      stylesheet. Note the link in the head of this document. In it, the
      relative path is used, similar to the 'src' attribute in an img html
      element.
    </p>
    <img src="images/IMG_5319.jpeg" alt="Bella doing it again." />
    <h2>Example 2: (Inline - Highest Precedence)</h2>
    <p>
      The styles for this image are inline. Don't do this. Styles applied this
      way take precedence over styles from tags and separate stylesheets. This
      method makes applying uniform styles very difficult.
    </p>
    <img
      src="images/IMG_5319.jpeg"
      alt="Bella doing it again."
      style="width: 25%"
    />
    <p>Note the styles for this image tag are overruling the stylesheet.</p>
    <h2>Example 3: (Style Tag in Head)</h2>
    <p>
      The styles for this image are in the head fo the document. These styles
      are still higher order than the stylesheet but not as much as inine styles
      (remember, DON'T do that, ha), so you'll notice the image is smaller than
      the rule applied from the stylesheet.
    </p>
    <img
      class="bella"
      src="images/IMG_5319.jpeg"
      alt="Bella doing it again."
    />
    <p>Note the styles for this image tag are targeted via a class selector.</p>
